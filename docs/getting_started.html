<h1>EEG Matlab Toolbox: Getting Started</h1>

<p>This document is an initial attempt to help new users get started with the
toolbox.  It is unlikely to cover all aspects of the toolbox, but
it appears to be a reliable starting point on several installations to date.
The toolbox provides some easy ways to visualize data.  This document works 
entirely with the example data provided with the toolbox and finishes with 
some clear suggestions on the next steps to getting your data to work.</p>



<h2>Installation</h2>
<p>First download the archives for the eeg_toolbox and the mri_toolbox via
<a href='http://eeg.sf.net'>http://eeg.sf.net</a>.  Also download the
example data archives for each.  Unpack the archives using tar or winzip 
or your favourite archive software.  They can be "installed" into
separate folders (directories) anywhere on your file system.  Once all the
archives are extracted, start matlab and 'cd' into the installation directory
or add the full path of the installation folder(s) to your matlab path - 
see the addpath command.  Then type 'eeg_toolbox'.  If you have any trouble
getting this far, please subscribe to the users email list via this easy 
subscription site:
<a href='http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/eeg-users'>
         http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/eeg-users</a>
then post your email to eeg-users@lists.sourceforge.net and we can sort out
the installation.  Actually, it is a good idea to subscribe to this list
anyway, because new releases and bugs are notified there.</p>

<p>There is a lot of documentation already in the help system, just type
'help eeg_toolbox' at the command prompt to see a full listing of functions 
in the toolbox.  Similarly, 'help mri_toolbox'.  If that fails, email 
eeg-users@lists.sourceforge.net.</p>



<h2>Exploring the Example Data</h2>

<p>The following GUI tour can be summarised, to some extent, in this
command line script:<br>
p = eeg_toolbox_defaults<br>
p = eeg_open(p)<br>
p = elec_open(p)<br>
p = mesh_open(p)<br>
p = gui_erp_plot(p)<br>
p = eeg_contours_engine(p)<br>
So, this will open an ERP file, the associated electrodes and
realistic scalp mesh.  It will then create GUI interfaces to explore the 
ERP data, including a timeseries plot and a topographic map.  You can see
how easy it is to use the toolbox, given the example data!  At this point, you
can explore the interface on the ERP plot and topographic map.  Now for the 
GUI tour of how to get to this point...</p>

<p>Type 'eeg_toolbox' at the matlab prompt. It will initialise the default
parameters and display the folling GUI:</p>

<img alt="eeg_toolbox main menu" src="images/eeg_toolbox.gif" />

<p>This is the main access point to loading data.  If this is the first time
you've seen this, its best to reinitialise the default parameters
using the Parameters -> Reset Defaults and then Parameters -> Save Defaults
commands.  If there are any problems at this stage, please email the errors 
to the eeg-users list.  Assuming that works alright, lets now consider 
the 'file' menu:</p>

<img alt="eeg_toolbox main menu" src="images/eeg_toolbox_file_open.gif" /><br>

<p>From the file menu, open voltage, electrode, tesselations or mri data 
(see further details on these below).  There is also an attempt to keep track 
of recent data structures.  These can be created using 
Parameters -> Save As Data Workspace command.</p>

<img alt="eeg_toolbox main menu" src="images/eeg_toolbox_parameters.gif" /><br>

<p>The return command will return the toolbox data structure to the matlab
workspace, although this structure is constantly updated in the workspace
during operations in the toolbox.  The default parameters can be used to 
explore the toolbox with the default data in 'eeg_example_data'.  When you 
are familiar with the toolbox and can see some benefit from it, take a look 
at the 'eeg_toolbox_defaults.m' function and modify as necessary.  This 
function initialises the data structure that is the key to everything.  
All functions in the toolbox pass and process the 'p' data structure.  
As matlab is smart at passing by reference or by value, as necessary, it 
shouldn't be too memory hungry, but there has been no conscientious 
effort to manage memory carefully.  If you open too many datasets, 
especially ones with dense tesselations, it might get memory 
hungry.</p>

<p>To get started with looking at the example data, try File -> Open Voltage
and leave all the defaults, click Plot and fill in the parameters with the
values given below in the example figure (ERP PARAMETERS).  Once this ERP plot 
is given, click the ELEC button and then return (or plot) in that GUI.  That 
will load (and plot) the default electrode dataset.  Then click on the MESH 
button and return to load the default mesh set.  At this point, your ready to 
look at topographic maps.  Select any time point of the ERP waveform by 
clicking on it and then hit the TOPO button.  You should see a top view of the 
scalp topography.  Click anywhere on the viewer and it will start to rotate with
the mouse movements.  Try the animation controls too (which allows saving
of graphics and movies).  That's the topography based on the electrodes only.
Now close the topography window and go back to the ERP waveform plot.  Click
on the GUI checkbox below the TOPO button and then note the checkboxes near
the bottom of the window - uncheck Elec Surface and check Mesh Surface. Then
hit plot and wait - it will calculate a surface interpolation from
the scalp electrodes to the scalp tesselation vertices and plot the
realistic scalp topography.  Yippee!  If the MRI toolbox is installed, you
can also open Analyze 7.5 data.  If you get this far, your well on the way
to using the toolbox on your data.  Below is some more information about
using the GUI interface.  Play around with the ERP plot window, there are
some nice interactive features for PRECISE measurement of data values.  This
GUI uses the same functions available in a general matlab function called
crosshair (which has been downloaded thousands of times and used in all kinds
of fascinating work around the globe ;-), see 
<a href='http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/loadAuthor.do?objectType=author&objectId=445317'>
my matlab file exchange page</a>).  Place the mouse over various elements of
the GUI and it will give popup help immediately.</p>

<p>Each of the file open GUIs appears very similar (as below).  They each
provide edit fields that contain the current file path and filename and
facilities to browse for a file, plot the data and close the GUI.  The
'Hold GUI' checkbox allows control of whether the GUI automatically closes
after a plot command.  Each of these GUIs returns the 'p' data structure
to the main eeg_toolbox GUI and the matlab workspace.  These GUIs call the
eeg_open.m, elec_open.m and mesh_open.m functions, which control loading
and plotting of the data.  These functions can be called directly from
the command prompt.</p>

<img alt="eeg_toolbox main menu" src="images/open_voltage.gif" /><br>
<img alt="eeg_toolbox main menu" src="images/open_electrodes.gif" /><br>
<img alt="eeg_toolbox main menu" src="images/open_mesh.gif" /><br>

<p>These GUIs provide access to various data types/formats.</p>

<img alt="eeg_toolbox main menu" src="images/open_voltage_type.gif" /><br>

<p>For ERP timeseries, the ascii format should provide access to most data.  The
ascii file should contain only a matrix of potential values, no channel labels. 
The Neuroscan .avg format is well supported, and the matlab option provides 
access to binary files (via 'eeg_load.m').</p>

<p>The toolbox will attempt to arrange an EEG/ERP data matrix so that it has 
N rows of ERP sample points from M columns of electrodes (N>M is assumed). 
Many matlab functions assume that channels are given by column vectors 
(eg, the signal processing toolbox). One assumption made in the toolbox 
is that there are more ERP sample points than there are channels and it will
try to arrange input data so that channels are column vectors.</p>

<p>An example of filtering an ERP waveform may be attained if you have the
signal processing toolbox. For example, the following implements a 50 Hz 
lowpass filter:<br>
<code>lowpassHz = 50;</code><br>
<code>[b,a] = butter(15,lowpassHz/p.volt.sampleHz);</code><br>
<code>data  = filtfilt(b,a,p.volt.data);</code><br>
</p>

<p>The ERP parameters button provides GUI access to defining essential epoch
and sampling parameters:</p>

<img alt="eeg_toolbox main menu" src="images/erp_parameters2.gif" /><br>

<p>These parameters will be read from Neuroscan .avg files, where possible, but
must be entered for ascii data (although a first guess at electrodes and points
is made from the size of the data matrix).  If all essential parameters are 
not defined, this dialog box is opened during the plot command.</p>

<img alt="eeg_toolbox main menu" src="images/open_electrodes_type.gif" /><br>

<p>For electrodes, ascii data is supported and some other formats are available
(scantri is from Neuroscan 3Dspace, Brainstorm and EMSE files are also there, 
either in the GUI already or at least via the command line).  The ascii files 
can be Cartesian or spherical coordinates.  See 'help elec_load' for more 
information on ascii data and 'help elec_open' in general.  Also see the 
format of the default electrode file in the example data folder.</p>

<img alt="eeg_toolbox main menu" src="images/open_mesh_type.gif" /><br>

<p>For meshes (tesselations), the toolbox can read ascii data in the
FreeSurfer or EMSE formats and functions are available to read binary
FreeSurfer files too.  The toolbox can also read BrainStorm tesselations.
See 'help mesh_open' for more information.</p>
